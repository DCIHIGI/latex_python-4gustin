abstract = {We investigate the possibility that dark matter could be made of scalar candidates and focus, in particular, on the unusual mass range between a few MeVs and a few GeVs. After showing why the Lee–Weinberg limit (which usually forbids a dark matter mass below a few GeVs) does not necessarily apply in the case of scalar particles, we discuss how light candidates (mdm<O(GeV)) can satisfy both the gamma ray and relic density constraints. We find two possibilities. Either dark matter is coupled to heavy fermions (but if mdm≲100 MeV, an asymmetry between the dark matter particle and antiparticle number densities is likely to be required), or dark matter is coupled to a new light gauge boson U. The (collisional) damping of light candidates is, in some circumstances, large enough to be mentioned, but in most cases too small to generate a non-linear matter power spectrum at the present epoch that differs significantly from the cold dark matter spectrum. On the other hand, heavier scalar dark matter particles (i.e., with mdm≳O(GeV)) turn out to be much less constrained. We finally discuss a theoretical framework for scalar candidates, inspired from theories with N=2 extended supersymmetry and/or extra space dimensions, in which the dark matter stability results from a new discrete (or continuous) symmetry.}

	journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
	abstract = {We analyze the observed properties of dwarf galaxies, which are dark matter dominated astrophysical objects, by assuming that dark matter is in the form of a strongly-coupled, dilute Bose-Einstein condensate. The basic astrophysical properties of the condensate (density profile, rotational velocity, and mass profile, respectively), are derived from a variational principle. To test the validity of the model we compare first the tangential velocity equation of the model with a sample of eight rotation curves of dwarf galaxies. We find a good agreement between the theoretically predicted rotation curves (without any baryonic component) and the observational data. The mean value of the logarithmic inner slope of the mass density profile of dwarf galaxies is also obtained, and it is shown that the observed value of this parameter is in agreement with the theoretical results. The predictions of the Bose-Einstein condensate model are also systematically compared with the predictions of the standard Cold Dark Matter model. The non-singular density profiles of the Bose-Einstein condensed dark matter generally show the presence of an extended core, whose presence is due to the strong interaction between dark matter particles.}

    abstract = "{Using the scalar field dark matter (SFDM) model, it is proposed that galaxies form by condensation of a scalar field (SF) very early in the Universe, forming Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) drops (i.e. in this model, the haloes of galaxies are gigantic drops of SF). Here, as in the Λ cold dark matter (LCDM) model, large structures form by hierarchy, and thus all the predictions of the LCDM model at large scales are reproduced by the SFDM model. This model predicts that all galaxies must be very similar and must exist for larger redshifts than in the LCDM model. In this paper, we show that BEC dark matter haloes fit the high-resolution rotation curves of a sample of 13 low-surface-brightness galaxies. We compare our fits to those obtained using Navarro–Frenk–White and pseudo-isothermal (PI) profiles. We have found better agreement with the SFDM and PI profiles. The mean value of the logarithmic inner density slopes is α=−0.27 ± 0.18. As a second result, we find a natural way to define the core radius with the advantage of being model-independent. Using this new definition in the BEC density profile, we find that the recent observation of the constant dark matter central surface density can be reproduced. We conclude that, in light of the difficulties that the standard model is currently facing, the SFDM model could be a worthy alternative to enable us to continue exploring further.}",

In addition, we derive an expression for the mean shear interior to a given radius, (x), and use this to quantify systematic errors that will arise in weak-lensing mass estimates of astronomical objects in cases where the mass estimate is based on an a priori assumption that the underlying potential is that of a singular isothermal sphere when in fact the potential is that of an NFW-type object. On mass scales of 1011 M☉ ≲ M200 ≲ 1015 M☉, the assumption of an isothermal sphere potential results in an overestimate of the halo mass, and the amount by which the mass is overestimated increases linearly with the value of the NFW concentration parameter. Considerable overestimates of the mass (~60\%) can occur for galaxy-sized halos, but for rich clusters the mass overestimate is small. The degree to which the mass is systematically in error depends on the cosmology adopted, with a COBE-normalized standard cold dark matter (CDM) model yielding the largest systematic errors for a given true value of the halo mass.}

All targets were selected for higher redshift emission lines and lower redshift continuum in a single Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectrum. The foreground galaxies are primarily of early-type morphology, with redshifts from z≃ 0.05 to 0.5 and velocity dispersions from σ ≃ 160 to 400 km s−1; the faint background emission-line galaxies have redshifts ranging from z≃ 0.2 to 1.2. We confirm 70 systems showing clear evidence of multiple imaging of the background galaxy by the foreground galaxy, as well as an additional 19 systems with probable multiple imaging. For 63 clear lensing systems, we present singular isothermal ellipsoid and light-traces-mass gravitational lens models fitted to the ACS imaging data. These strong-lensing mass measurements are supplemented by magnitudes and effective radii measured from ACS surface brightness photometry and redshifts and velocity dispersions measured from SDSS spectroscopy. These data constitute a unique resource for the quantitative study of the interrelations between mass, light, and kinematics in massive early-type galaxies. We show that the SLACS lens sample is statistically consistent with being drawn at random from a parent sample of SDSS galaxies with comparable spectroscopic parameters and effective radii, suggesting that the results of SLACS analyses can be generalized to the massive early-type population.}
